* The steps below are the steps taken for this math.js script file to working. 
* It uses any input number by the visitor to do all available basic math problems

- [x] **User Story #1:** Attach this file -- math.js -- to the index.html file using a <script> tag.

- [x] **User Story #2:** Add an alert to announce the program with a message like "Let's do some math!".

- [x] **User Story #3:** Create a variable and use the prompt() method to collect a number from a visitor.

- [x] **User Story #4:** Convert that value from a string to a floating point number.

- [x] **User Story #5:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create a second variable and collect a second number.

- [x] **User Story #6:** Create a new variable -- message -- which you'll use to build a complete message to print to the document,
start by creating a string that includes **H1** tags as well and the two input numbers. 
The string **'Math with the numbers 3 and 4'** should be in a **H1** tag and where the two numbers are the values input from the user should use the string **concatenation** to create this and make sure you actually perform the math on the values by using the + symbol to add their values together.

- [x] **User Story #7:** Add another string to the message variable.<br>
The string should look something like this after concatenation: "3 + 4 = 7"

- [x] **User Story #8:** Continue to add to the message variable to include strings demonstrating multiplication, division and subtraction.<br>For example: "3 * 4 = 12" "3 / 4 = 0.75" "3 - 4 = -1"

- [x] **User Story #9:** Use the document.write() method to print the message variable to the web page.<br>
