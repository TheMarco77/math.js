# Team Treehouse math workshop | math.js | by using the visitors number inputs to do math. Addition, multiplication, division and subtract

* The steps below are the steps taken for this math.js script file to working. 
* It uses any input number by the visitor to do all available basic math problems

- [x] **User Story #1:** Attach this file -- math.js -- to the index.html file using a <script> tag.

- [x] **User Story #2:** Add an alert to announce the program with a message like "Let's do some math!".

- [x] **User Story #3:** Create a variable and use the prompt() method to collect a number from a visitor.

- [x] **User Story #4:** Convert that value from a string to a floating point number.

- [x] **User Story #5:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create a second variable and collect a second number.

- [x] **User Story #6:** Create a new variable -- message -- which you'll use to build a complete message to print to the document
Start by creating a string that includes **H1** tags as well and the two input numbers. The string **'Math with the numbers 3 and 4'** should be in a **H1** tag and where the two numbers are the values input from the user should use the string concatenation to create this and make sure you actually perform the math on the values by using the + symbol to add their values together.

- [x] **User Story #7:** Add another string to the message variable. The string should look something like this after concatenation: "3 + 4 = 7"

- [x] **User Story #8:** Continue to add to the message variable to include strings demonstrating multiplication, division and subtraction. For example: "3 * 4 = 12" "3 / 4 = 0.75" "3 - 4 = -1"

- [x] **User Story #9:** Use the document.write() method to print the message variable 
//     to the web page. Open the finished.png file in this workspace
//     to see what the completed output should look like
document.write(message);

- [x] **User Story #10:** The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.

- [x] **User Story #11:** The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

* Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
